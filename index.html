        <h1>My name is Cameron Custis</h1>
        <p>I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina in 2002 but, while I do live in Raleigh today, my family moved around a lot in my early years. I enjoy writing, travelling and playing games in my free time. My favorite song right now is <em>MY EYES</em> by Travis Scott and my favorite food is sushi.</p>
